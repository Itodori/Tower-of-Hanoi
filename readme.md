# **Tower of Hanoi**

This project is a Python implementation of the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle game. The objective of the game is to move a stack of disks from one rod to another, following specific rules.

## Game Rules

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the top disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
